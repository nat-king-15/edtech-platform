# Admin Approval Workflow and Batch Publishing Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the admin approval workflow and batch publishing mechanism that ensures content quality and readiness before making batches visible to students. The system includes content validation, batch publishing controls, and announcement capabilities.

## Batch Publishing Workflow

### Batch Lifecycle States

1. **Draft** (`status: 'draft'`)
   - Initial state when batch is created
   - Not visible to students
   - Content can be added and modified
   - Teachers can schedule content

2. **Published** (`status: 'published'`)
   - Batch has passed content validation
   - Visible to students
   - Content is accessible for learning
   - Announcements can be made

### Publishing Requirements

Before a batch can be published, it must meet these criteria:

1. **Subject Validation**
   - Batch must have at least one active subject
   - All subjects must be properly configured

2. **Content Validation**
   - Each subject must have at least one scheduled content item
   - Content can be videos, PDFs, or other learning materials
   - This ensures students have something to learn from

3. **Administrative Approval**
   - Only admin users can publish batches
   - Publishing action is logged with admin details

## API Endpoints

### Publish Batch

**Endpoint:** `PUT /api/admin/batches/:batchId/publish`

**Authentication:** Admin only

**Request:**
```http
PUT /api/admin/batches/batch_12345/publish
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Success Response (200):**

    "status": "published",
    "publishedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "subjectsCount": 5,
    "contentValidation": [
      {
        "subjectId": "subject_1",
        "hasContent": true
      },
      {
        "subjectId": "subject_2",
        "hasContent": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**

{
  "error": "Batch Already Published",
  "message": "This batch is already published"
}
```

**Insufficient Content (400):**
```javascript
{
  "error": "Insufficient Content",
  "message": "Cannot publish batch. The following subjects have no scheduled content: Physics, Chemistry",
  "details": {
    "subjectsWithoutContent": ["Physics", "Chemistry"]
  }
}
```

**No Subjects (400):**
```javascript
{
  "error": "No Subjects Found",
  "message": "Cannot publish batch without any subjects"
}
```

### Create Batch Announcement

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/admin/batches/:batchId/announcements`

**Authentication:** Admin only

**Request:**
```http
POST /api/admin/batches/batch_12345/announcements
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "New Assignment Available",
  "content": "A new physics assignment has been uploaded. Please complete it by Friday."
}
```

**Success Response (201):**
```javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Announcement created successfully",
  "data": {
    "announcementId": "announcement_789",
    "batchId": "batch_12345",
    "global": false,
    "title": "New Assignment Available",
    "content": "A new physics assignment has been uploaded. Please complete it by Friday.",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z",
    "createdBy": "admin_uid_123",
    "batchInfo": {
      "title": "JEE Main 2024 Batch A"
    }
  }
}
```

## Content Validation Logic

### Validation Process

1. **Subject Discovery**
   ```javascript
   // Get all active subjects for the batch
   const subjectsSnapshot = await firestore.collection('subjects')
     .where('batchId', '==', batchId)
     .where('isActive', '==', true)
     .get();
   ```

2. **Content Check**
   ```javascript
   // Check if each subject has at least one content item
   const contentValidation = await Promise.all(
     subjectIds.map(async (subjectId) => {
       const scheduleSnapshot = await firestore.collection('schedule')
         .where('subjectId', '==', subjectId)
         .where('batchId', '==', batchId)
         .limit(1)
         .get();
       
       return {
         subjectId,
         hasContent: !scheduleSnapshot.empty
       };
     })
   );
   ```

3. **Validation Result**
   - If any subject lacks content, publishing is blocked
   - Detailed error message lists subjects without content
   - Admin can address content gaps before retrying

### Content Types Considered

The validation accepts any content type from the schedule collection:
- `VIDEO_LECTURE`
- `LECTURE_NOTES_PDF`
- `DPP_PDF`
- `DPP_VIDEO_SOLUTION`

## Database Updates

### Batch Document Updates

When a batch is published, the following fields are updated:

```javascript
{
  status: 'published',
  publishedAt: new Date(),
  publishedBy: req.user.uid
}
```

### Announcement Document Structure

```javascript
{
  batchId: "batch_12345",
  title: "Announcement Title",
  content: "Announcement content...",
  createdAt: new Date(),
  createdBy: "admin_uid_123",
  global: false
}
```

## Email Notifications

### Publishing Notification

When a batch is successfully published:
- Admin receives confirmation email
- Email includes batch title and publication timestamp
- Failure to send email is logged but doesn't block publishing

### Announcement Notification

When an announcement is created:
- Admin receives confirmation email
- Email includes announcement title and target batch
- Email failures are logged as warnings

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- All endpoints require valid authentication token
- Admin role verification through custom claims
- Batch existence validation before operations

### Input Validation
- Announcement title and content are required and trimmed
- Batch ID validation prevents invalid operations
- Content length limits prevent abuse

### Data Integrity
- Server-generated timestamps prevent manipulation
- Atomic operations ensure data consistency
- Proper error handling prevents partial updates

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios

1. **Authentication Errors (401)**
   - Invalid or expired token
   - Missing authentication header

2. **Authorization Errors (403)**
   - Non-admin user attempting admin operations
   - Insufficient permissions

3. **Validation Errors (400)**
   - Missing required fields
   - Invalid batch ID
   - Insufficient content for publishing

4. **Not Found Errors (404)**
   - Batch doesn't exist
   - Invalid batch ID

5. **Server Errors (500)**
   - Database connection issues
   - Unexpected system errors

## Best Practices
