# Courses Collection Structure

## Overview
The `courses` collection in Firestore stores course information for the EdTech platform. Each document represents a course that can have multiple batches.

## Collection Path
```
firestore/courses/{courseId}
```

## Document Structure

### Required Fields
- `title` (string): Course title/name.
- `category` (string): Course category (e.g., "Mathematics", "Science", "Programming").

### Optional Fields
- `thumbnailUrl` (string): URL to the course thumbnail image.
- `description` (string): Detailed course description.
- `createdAt` (string): ISO timestamp when the course was created.
- `updatedAt` (string): ISO timestamp when the course was last updated.
- `createdBy` (string): UID of the admin who created the course.
- `isActive` (boolean): Whether the course is active/available.
- `tags` (array): Array of tags for better categorization.

## Example Document
```json
{
  "title": "Advanced Mathematics",
  "category": "Mathematics",
  "thumbnailUrl": "https://example.com/images/math-course.jpg",
  "description": "Comprehensive advanced mathematics course covering calculus, algebra, and statistics",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "createdBy": "admin-uid-123",
  "isActive": true,
  "tags": ["calculus", "algebra", "statistics"]
}
```

## Categories
Common course categories:
- Mathematics
- Science
- Programming
- Languages
- Business
- Arts
- Engineering

## Security Rules
The collection should be protected with Firestore security rules:
- Only admins can create, update, or delete courses.
- All users can read course information.
- Teachers can read courses they are assigned to teach.

## Indexing
Recommended indexes for efficient queries:
- `category` (ascending)
- `isActive` (ascending)
- `createdAt` (descending)
- `title` (ascending)

## Usage Notes
1. Course IDs are auto-generated by Firestore.
2. Thumbnail URLs should be validated for proper format if provided.
3. Categories should be standardized to maintain consistency.
4. Always set `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps.
5. Courses can be soft-deleted by setting `isActive` to false.
