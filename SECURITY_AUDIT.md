# Security Audit Report - EdTech Platform

## Executive Summary

**Date**: January 18, 2025  
**Audit Type**: Emergency Security Incident Response  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Status**: REMEDIATION IN PROGRESS  

### Incident Overview
Critical security vulnerability discovered: sensitive production credentials were exposed in environment files committed to the git repository. This exposure potentially compromised multiple third-party services and authentication systems.

## Vulnerability Details

### 1. Exposed Credentials
The following sensitive data was found in committed `.env` files:

#### Firebase Services
- **Admin SDK Private Key**: Full RSA-2048 private key exposed
- **API Key**: Client-side Firebase API key compromised
- **Service Account Details**: Complete service account configuration exposed
- **Project Configuration**: Database URLs and storage bucket details revealed

#### Third-Party Services
- **Mux Video Platform**: Access tokens and webhook secrets exposed
- **Gmail SMTP**: App-specific password compromised
- **Redis Database**: Connection URL and authentication password exposed
- **JWT Authentication**: Secret key for token signing compromised

### 2. Impact Assessment

#### Immediate Risks
- **Authentication Bypass**: JWT secret compromise allows token forgery
- **Data Access**: Firebase admin access enables full database manipulation
- **Service Disruption**: Mux and email services vulnerable to abuse
- **Session Hijacking**: Redis access allows session manipulation

#### Potential Attack Vectors
- Unauthorized database access and data exfiltration
- Email spoofing and phishing attacks
- Video content manipulation or deletion
- User session hijacking and impersonation
- Service denial through quota exhaustion

## Remediation Actions Taken

### ✅ Immediate Response (Completed)

#### 1. Repository Sanitization
- **Environment File Sanitization**: Replaced all real secrets with placeholders in `.env.example` files
- **Git History Purging**: Used `git filter-repo` to remove sensitive files from entire git history
- **Tracking Prevention**: Removed tracked `.env` files from git cache
- **Enhanced .gitignore**: Added comprehensive patterns to prevent future `.env` file commits

#### 2. Access Control
- **Git Remote Removal**: Origin remote automatically removed during history rewrite
- **File Permissions**: Verified local environment files are properly secured

### 🔄 In Progress

#### 3. Credential Rotation
All exposed credentials require immediate rotation (see `CREDENTIAL_ROTATION_STATUS.md`):
- Firebase Admin SDK service account key
- Firebase API key with proper restrictions
- Gmail app password regeneration
- Mux access tokens and webhook secrets
- Redis database password
- JWT signing secret (256-bit minimum)

### 📋 Recommended Actions

#### 4. Security Hardening

##### A. CI/CD Pipeline Security
```yaml
# Recommended GitHub Actions workflow for secret scanning
name: Security Scan
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  secret-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Run Gitleaks
        uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

##### B. Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Install pre-commit hook to prevent .env commits
pip install pre-commit
cat > .pre-commit-config.yaml << EOF
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: check-added-large-files
      - id: check-merge-conflict
      - id: detect-private-key
  - repo: https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets
    rev: v1.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: detect-secrets
        args: ['--baseline', '.secrets.baseline']
        exclude: package.lock.json
EOF
pre-commit install
```

##### C. Environment Variable Management
- **Development**: Use `.env.local` (never committed)
- **Staging**: Use secure environment variable injection
- **Production**: Use cloud provider secret management (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)

##### D. Monitoring and Alerting
- Enable audit logging for all services
- Set up anomaly detection for unusual access patterns
- Implement webhook signature verification
- Monitor for credential usage from unexpected locations

## Security Best Practices Implementation

### 1. Secret Management
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Rotate credentials with minimal required permissions
- **Regular Rotation**: Implement quarterly credential rotation schedule
- **Secure Storage**: Use dedicated secret management solutions
- **Access Logging**: Enable comprehensive audit trails

### 2. Development Workflow
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory security review for all environment-related changes
- **Branch Protection**: Require status checks including secret scanning
- **Developer Training**: Security awareness training on credential handling

### 3. Infrastructure Security
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate production services
- **Encryption**: Ensure all data in transit and at rest is encrypted
- **Access Controls**: Implement multi-factor authentication for all admin accounts
- **Backup Security**: Secure and test backup/recovery procedures

## Compliance and Reporting

### Regulatory Considerations
- **GDPR**: Potential data breach notification requirements
- **SOC 2**: Impact on security controls and audit requirements
- **Industry Standards**: Review against OWASP Top 10 and security frameworks

### Stakeholder Communication
- **Internal Teams**: Immediate notification to development and operations teams
- **Management**: Executive briefing on incident and remediation status
- **Customers**: Assess need for customer notification based on data exposure risk

## Verification and Testing

### Post-Remediation Checklist
- [ ] All services functioning with new credentials
- [ ] No authentication failures in production logs
- [ ] Webhook signatures validating correctly
- [ ] Email delivery functioning normally
- [ ] Video streaming services operational
- [ ] Database connections stable
- [ ] JWT token validation working
- [ ] Redis cache operations normal

### Security Testing
- [ ] Penetration testing with old credentials (should fail)
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning of updated systems
- [ ] Access control verification
- [ ] Audit log review for suspicious activity

## Lessons Learned

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Process Gap**: Lack of pre-commit hooks for secret detection
2. **Training Gap**: Insufficient developer awareness of credential security
3. **Tooling Gap**: Missing automated secret scanning in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Review Gap**: Code review process didn't catch environment file commits

### Preventive Measures
1. **Automated Scanning**: Implement Gitleaks in CI/CD pipeline
2. **Developer Education**: Mandatory security training program
3. **Process Documentation**: Clear guidelines for environment variable handling
4. **Regular Audits**: Quarterly security reviews of repository contents
